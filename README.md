# AAA M+ Additions

A World of Warcraft Addon that adds tracking for Mythic+.

Whenever a key starts, the run is tracked. When you complete the dungeon the data is recorded. When a player leaves or the dungeon ends for a number of other reasons, the addon should track who left or what happenned.

The Addon also keeps track of all deaths and the last 5 events that happened before the death, and stores the infor on each run.

There is a simple minimap button to access the interface where you can view all the run that have been recorded.
